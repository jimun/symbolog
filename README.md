# symbolog

- A simple iOS app for tracking symbol markings for documentation/whatever purpose. 

- I wanted to create a tool to help keep track of symbols for inductive Bible study and also have a practice at making an iOS app. So here it is! It's not much, but it does the job. I haven't uploaded it to the App Store and probably won't, hence I'm uploading it on Github. I'll probably make few updates to this app as I continue to use it.
